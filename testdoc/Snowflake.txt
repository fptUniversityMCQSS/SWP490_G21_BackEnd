MEANING
“Snowflaking” is a method of normalizing the dimension tables in a STAR schema.
When you completely normalize all the dimension tables, the resultant structure resembles a
 snowflake with the fact table in the middle. The principle behind snowflaking is normalization
 of the dimension tables by removing low cardinality attributes and forming separate tables

Advantages
† Small savings in storage space
† Normalized structures are easier to update and maintain

Disadvantages
† Schema less intuitive and end-users are put off by the complexity
† Ability to browse through the contents difficult
† Degraded query performance because of additional joins
